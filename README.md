# Travel-OOP-thing

We decided to base our project on a Hotel rating system. It lets users record their trips with details like location,
date, rating. Trips could be sorted by date or rating and searched by country.

Stage 1 — Design & Prototype (Week 9, 40%)

Define your entity and build a working prototype using Lists.
Justify key design choices in a short README.

 Stage 1 — What to deliver (40%)
Marking: Functional (24%)
Criterion	Description	Weight
Entity Definition	≥7 typed fields; encapsulated; validation with clear messages.	6%
CSV Loading	Load exactly 10 rows; print valid-count and a sample listing.	5%
Data Structure Choice	Use ArrayList or LinkedList with justification; show iteration and safe removal.	3%
Ordering & Searching	Implement Comparable (natural order) and one Comparator; show search/sort.	4%
DRY & Defensive Coding	Early exits, helper methods for repeated logic; no duplication hotspots.	3%
Reporting & Output	Brief, readable console output or formatted listing.	3%
